This is a GUI based Project for the purpose of DFA-Minimization created using the Language C++ and a Graphical Library SFML
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run this Project on your system you need to have Visual Studio
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Steps to Execute this project:
- clone this repository on your visual studio
- open the project solution file and right click on the project solution to open its properties picture attached for reference

- Then Follow the following youtube link to setup your visual studio enviorment

- If the setup is successful then the errors showing that the sfml files are not included will be removed


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since the project is created on SFML I faced a few limitations so to counter it:
- Maximum of 12 States are allowed for minimization with only 3 variables

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
when you will run the project the mainpage will prompt to enter the number of states, number of variables and number of final states
to input you will have to click the input field to activate it
After inputs, there will be n number of states printed on the screen so first you will have to select all the final states by clicking on the states
Then you will have to draw the transitions from one state to another the active variable is representated by their respective color
- Green for A
- Purple for B
- Yellow For C
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After drawing the transitions a minimized table will be Displayed.
